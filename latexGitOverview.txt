  Sample
    [CODE]
      \documentclass[12pt]{article}

      \begin{document}
      \maketitle
      \LaTeX{} is a document preparation system for the \TeX{}
      typesetting program. It offers programmable desktop publishing
      features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of
      typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and
      cross-referencing, tables and figures, page layout, bibliographies,
      and much more. \LaTeX{} was originally written in 1984 by Leslie
      Lamport and has become the dominant method for using \TeX; few
      people write in plain \TeX{} anymore. The current version is
      \LaTeXe.

      % This is a comment; it will not be shown in the final output.
      % The following shows a little of the typesetting power of LaTeX:
      \begin{align}
      E &= mc^2                              \\
           m &= \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
           \end{align}
           \end{document}
